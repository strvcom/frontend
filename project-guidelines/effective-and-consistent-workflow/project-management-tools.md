# Project Management Tools

Whenever you build anything bigger than a landing page, it’s great practice to plan your work—especially when you work in a team. You can set up tasks, subtasks or workflows. You can link them to each other and integrate them with GitHub or Slack. Plan your releases or write down documentation.

## Trello

[Trello](https://trello.com) is one of the best [Kanban boards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board) available. The simplicity of this product is what makes it ideal for smaller projects.

## JIRA

For bigger projects where multiple departments are involved, [JIRA](https://jira.atlassian.com) i is a perfect companion. It offers a really rich Project Management experience. You can use numerous integrations and set up pretty much anything. You can also use and connect other Atlassian products, like [Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence) for specifications and documentation.

STRV has its own \[TODO: Add Link\] JIRA flow, which has been tailored to our needs.

## GitHub Projects, GitHub Milestones

[GitHub Milestones](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-milestones) is great for your workflow. It’s simple to use, centralizes the information and helps you track what needs to get done.

[GitHub Projects](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-project-boards) help you organize and prioritize your work. You can create project boards for specific feature work, comprehensive roadmaps, or even release checklists. With project boards, you have the flexibility to create customized workflows that suit your needs.
