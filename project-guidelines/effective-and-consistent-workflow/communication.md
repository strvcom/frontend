# Communication

Communication is the key to success. It’s a well-known rule applicable not just in frontend development, but pretty much anywhere. Be transparent, share updates, notice blockers. And **be nice**! In the end, the tone of voice can influence a lot of situations.

It’s good practice to share a **small written standup** with your team, describing what you’ve done today, what you’re planning to do tomorrow and if there is any blocker preventing you from performing your job. It’s not bad to do even if you’re working on a project alone.

Besides written communication, there is also the verbal one. Learn how to speak. How to handle unpleasant calls. Sometimes, clients come in with silly requests. You must be on top of them. **Be professional**.
