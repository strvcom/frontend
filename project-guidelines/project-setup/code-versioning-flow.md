# Code versioning flow

Good git practices, meaningful commit messages, branch strategies, pull request templates. All of these improve efficiency and consistency. And it’s all very helpful for onboarding.

Community standard is a git-flow which is embracing doing a semantic release. We recommend using it on larger projects.

But overall [be a good “commitzen”](code-quality-tools.md#commitlint) and use [Code quality tools](code-quality-tools.md). They will help to establish a nice and easy way of following commit history.
