# Quality Assurance

It's always handy to have an extra pair of eyes to check your output. At STRV, we have a dedicated QA team for each project.

Whenever you work on a project for a long time, you start getting \[tunnel vision\]\([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnel\_vision\_\(metaphor\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnel_vision_%28metaphor%29)\). This results in not seeing obvious bugs.

Having QA on a team working on larger projects is not just nice to have, but actually very important and mandatory.

It’s not the responsibility of the developer to lobby having QA engineers on the project. But since we are here to build a successful product, this could be a really nice recommendation to your client. In the end, everybody wants to have a bugless, beautifully working app. So why not try it out?
