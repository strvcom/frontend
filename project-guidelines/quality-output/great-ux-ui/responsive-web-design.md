# Responsive Web Design

Pay attention to detail. Do a mobile first design. And always think about edge-cases. Making a perfect responsive web app takes time and a lot of testing. Don’t underestimate **real device testing**. It’s the one which can provide you with the most valuable feedback.

Typically, apps are supposed to be optimized for mobile phones, tablets and desktop. Today, there are too many different devices with different screen sizes. Ideally, you should cover the most typical devices, like iPhones or Samsung/Android.
