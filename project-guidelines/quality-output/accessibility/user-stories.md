# User stories

We believe that is much better to develop apps for our possible audience, rather than counting on some generic checklist. Be more emphatic and develop your app for following users:

#### **HOME-OFFICE DANNY**

* Slow internet connection
* Keyboard user _\(two cats in the house = no mice in the house\)_ 

#### **PARTY DANNY**

* Direct light exposure
* Shaky hands
* Temporary hear loss 
* Possible colorblindness, when party too hard

#### **DANNY OLD**

* Low vision
* Mild short-term memory loss 

#### **DANNY THE DRIVER**

* Pays attention to the traffic, thus has low cognitive functions
* Uses VoiceOver
