# Fundamentals

## **A11y is a mindset**

Have you ever used a website with your hand broken? Maybe you had problems with reading that small text on your phone in direct sunlight. Or were you in a place where you had to mute your phone, but that one app became unusable without sound cues?

All of this falls under accessibility.

But wait. You might be thinking, Isn’t “accessibility” just making sure disabled people can use our product?

Accessibility, also known as a11y, is more of a mindset that ensures no user gets left behind when developing our apps. So join us on this journey of learning how and why to make our apps better. For everyone

{% hint style="info" %}
A11y stands for accessibility, because there are 11 characters between "a" and "y".

## A11y is not a feature

It's very important to realize, that a11y means a general usability. Thus it should be naturally a part of Definition of Done.

## WCAG

* Golden standard
* Ultimately all products should be WCAG compliant
* [WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/Overview.html#abstract) - we strive to have a default support for 2.4.10 \(as of now\)
* [WCAG for mobile](https://www.w3.org/TR/mobile-accessibility-mapping/)
