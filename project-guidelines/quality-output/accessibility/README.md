# Accessibility

The web can and should be accessible for anyone, despite any disabilities. Unfortunately, this optimization is not very common, yet it can make a big difference to your business. Itâ€™s simple: the more users feel catered to on your website, the more will become loyal customers who spread a good word.

If designs you are working with have accessibility issues, you should bring them up to the designer and, if that is not possible, address the issues with any stakeholder.
